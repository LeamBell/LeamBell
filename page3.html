    <h2>FOUNDING OF GLOCK GmbH</h2>
    <p>n the early 1980s, the Austrian Ministry of Defense proceeded with the modernization of the Austrian Armed Forces through an invitation to tender for a new service pistol, which it designated as “Pistole 80” or “P80”. The required self-defense pistol had to have a reduced weight, the highest level of reliability, and safe and simple operation. Gaston Glock recognized his great opportunity and saw a clear target before him: to design an innovative pistol that could be efficiently manufactured, and simple and safe to handle. To this end, he founded GLOCK GmbH in 1980.</p>
