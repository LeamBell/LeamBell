        <h2>Not every GLOCK is created equal. With over 50 different models, any GLOCK purchase can be a bit confusing with options ranging from different calibers, sizes, generations and dozens of options for modifying your GLOCK. It may be challenging to find the best pistol on the first purchase. Even seasoned GLOCK users might have difficulties choosing a pistol without hands-on-experience with the different models.</h2>
        <h2> With the GLOCK Partners a pool of retailers was created, who know their GLOCKs and help hundreds of customers annually in choosing their perfect model. Have a look at a variety of models and let an expert explain the advantages of each. Decide what your plans are for your new GLOCK and these partners will know which one will fit you best.</h2>

                <p>Glock pistols are absurdly simple for a modern firearm. You can take a Glock down to its parts and pieces with nothing more than a punch. Reflecting the gun's simplicity, just an eight-hour class makes you an official Glock armorer. This simplicity leads to a very high level of reliability.</p>
