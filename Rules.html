        <h1>BASIC RULES OF GUN SAFETY</h1>
    </header> 
    <div class="product-container">
        <div class="product">
          <h2>1</h2>
          <p>Treat every firearm as if they are loaded.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="product">
            <h2>2</h2>
            <p>Always keep the firearm pointed in a safe direction.</p>
            <p>A safe direction is one in which no one can be injured in the event the gun fires. Never point the gun (whether loaded or unloaded) at yourself or anyone else. In selecting a safe direction, you must consider that a bullet can ricochet or glance off any object it strikes (including even the surface of water), that it can penetrate walls, ceilings, floors and windows, and that even handgun bullets can travel over one mile, while some rifle bullets can travel several miles.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="product">
            <h2>3</h2>
            <p>Keep your finger off the trigger and outside the gun's trigger guard until the gun is pointed at the target and you have decided to fire.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="product">
            <h2>4</h2>
            <p>Always be sure that your target and what’s around and beyond it are safe before firing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="product">
            <h2>5</h2>
            <p>Whenever you handle a firearm, the first thing you should do (while keeping it pointed in a safe direction with your finger outside the trigger guard) is to remove the magazine and open the action to make sure the firearm is not loaded.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="product">
            <h2>6</h2>
            <p>Thoroughly read the instruction manual supplied with your firearm.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="product">
            <h2>7</h2>
            <p>Before firing your weapon, you should routinely make sure that your firearm is in good working order and that the barrel is clear of dirt and obstructions, including grease and excess lubricant.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="product">
            <h2>8</h2>
            <p>Only use ammunition recommended by the firearm manufacturer, and always be certain that the ammunition matches the caliber of your gun. The caliber of every GLOCK pistol is marked on the barrel and the slide.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="product">
            <h2>9</h2>

            <p>All firearms should be stored unloaded and secured in a locked storage case, inaccessible to children and untrained or unauthorized  adults.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="product">
            <h2>12</h2>
            <p>The transportation of firearms is regulated by Federal, State and local laws. Always transport your firearm in a safe, unloaded condition and in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

            <p>Glock pistols are absurdly simple for a modern firearm. You can take a Glock down to its parts and pieces with nothing more than a punch. Reflecting the gun's simplicity, just an eight-hour class makes you an official Glock armorer. This simplicity leads to a very high level of reliability.</p>
